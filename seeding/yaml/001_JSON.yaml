    JSON is a data format that is widely used because it is easily parsed by computers. Many API's supply you with data in this format. It stands for
    JavaScript Object Notation, but it is not exclusively Javascript. Many other programming
    languages support it as well.
  summary: >
    JSON is an easily parsed and widely used data format.

      JSON is built on two important notions. The first notion is objects.
      These are entities with key/value pairs. The second notion is arrays,
      also called unordered lists (unordered in the sense that the order of
      the items in the list is not necessarily meaningful).
    instructions:
      - Find out what Key/Value pairs are and what their relation is to unordered
        lists
      - Get a feel for the syntax by creating a meta-data set for your photos.
        It should be an array of objects(the photos) with the name of the
        photographer, url, location and the summary.

    description: >
      Syntax errors will be made more often than you
      would expect. A good way to fix these errors is to use a so-called linter
      to check your code.
    instructions:
      - Try to check JSON data in the plunker below for errors using JSONlint(find link below).

  - title: Structure your data
    description: >
      You now have syntactically correct data. But if the data isn't repetitive in some way,
      or keys are written differently
      from item to item, it will still be of no use. What are the important
      things you have to keep track of?
    instructions:
      - Fix the inconsistencies in this file
      - Look back at your own file, is it well structured?
      - Make sure that every photo's properties are grouped!
