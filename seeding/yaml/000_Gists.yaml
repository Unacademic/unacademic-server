    You would think one way to share code with your peers and/or friends would 
    be by e-mail. But mailing one's code is a hassle when you have to deal with 
    lots of different files and endless lines of code. Another way is to place 
    these on Github, a website made for and by programmers to store and share 
    code.
    Github offers two ways to do that. The first is making a repository. More on
    this will follow later. The second way is Gist, particulary handy for code 
    snippets and a lot easier -though with some limitations.
  summary: >
    Sharing code can be quite a hassle. Github offers solutions to this problem.
