    A script is a small bit of code that enables web browsers to do something 
    more than just displaying static results. Scripts are used in web design to 
    create dynamic pages. So far you have included noscript inside your polymer 
    element. The reason is because untill now we did not use the script 
    functionalities. There are some big differences between regular HTML scripts 
    and Polymer scripts. Scripts are extremely powerful and are responsible for
    the behaviour of your web-app.

      Where HTML specifies the strucutre, and CSS the styling, scripts allow
      for behaviour. To add behaviour you create a script tag and inside most
      commonly JavaScript is used. JavaScript works by finding a target HTML
      element, and then doing something to it, just like CSS, but the syntax is 
      different.
    instructions:
      - Open the plunker file in the resources and press run
      - Add the script tag
      - Inside the script tag target the blockquote by using its ID
      - Change the background color of the element using a script
      - The font of the author is too small make it bigger using a script

  - title: Set up a Script in Polymer
    description: >
      Now you know how to use scripts in regular HTML 
      but how do you do that in Polymer?
      When you do not include a script, you need to explicitly 
      tell Polymer that by adding the noscript attribute.
      When you do, you leave that attribute out.
      In Polymer the syntax to include a script is different from that in 
      regular HTML.
      Till now all the Polymer elements included this noscript.
      This time we add the basic syntax to include a script inside a Polymer 
      component.
    instructions:
      - Open the plunker file
      - Look at the basic script set up syntax
      - Remove the no script to start using the script
      - You do not have to add a script try to understand the syntax needed
        to allow the script to work
      - The values that are set contain content try to find where that content 
        is transferred to

  - title: Create Scripts with Polymer
    description: >
      In this case we will use the script to set our values, and we will use
      the double bracket method (like handlebars) to insert those values 
      elsewhere. 
      In Polymer we do not have to target specific elements.
      The element containing the script already indicates where we want our script to run. 
      This is an example where we do not just alter the styling anymore 
      but use a script to store information.
      This is useful in combination with the repeat attribute of Polymer's template tag. 
    instructions:
      - Open the plunker file
      - Inside the script there are two objects styles and quotes
      - Inside the blockquote you will find the word category
      - Replace the word category with a word that appropriatly describes
        it like "humor" or "sad"
      - Replace it by adding a field in the quotes object and using the double
        brackets to display it where it says category
