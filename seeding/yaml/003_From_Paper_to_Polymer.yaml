    You have made a mockup on paper and now you will make a mockup using Polymer.
    Maybe you want to rethink your design, maybe not.
    That is your choice.
    The functionalities do not have to work yet, but you will have to create a response.
    This is a group assignment, so make sure you all agree on the design of
    the mockup and divide the components or features amongst yourselves.
  summary: >
    From paper to Polymer, taking mocking up to a next level.

tasks:
  - title: Think in Components
    description: >
      The very first step is transforming your paper mockup into seperate
      Polymer elements.
      Think in modules, break up everything into the tiniest seperate component
      possible.
    instructions:
      - Make a mockup using Polymer components use your previous drawing
        and create components place it on the screen accordingly

  - title: Ask for Input
    description: >
      Make a number of input fields.
      This number can also be one.
    instructions:
      - Create a minimum of one input field using Javascript

  - title: Give a Response
    description: >
      The input fields do not truly have to work yet,
      the input fields only need to give some sort of feedback.
      This is easily accomplished with an alert.
      However, if you want to go overboard
      and add computational fireworks to your mockup,
      you are welcome to do that.
    instructions:
      - Create an alert response for every module that requires user interaction
