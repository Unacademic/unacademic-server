    By default, web Components are encapsulated. This means they function
    completely on their own. But what if you actually want them to communicate
    with each other? Because of their encapsulation we need to explicitly tell
    the components what data they want to receive or send. 

    When connected components are very powerful. They can instantly relay 
    information and can change each others content. 

  summary: > 
    Get components to communicate and change each others content.

  - title: Make the content in an element change
    description: >
      In the previous level you did a task on templating. On Plunker, the page 
      automatically reloads everytime you make a change; on a real web application 
      though, this is not a desirable behaviour; only the DOM element that changes
      should be reloaded. By using two-way data binding, only the relevant DOM 
      element changes when the data is changed and vice versa.

  - title: Relay information between Polymer elements
    description: >
      You have already built a Polymer element. You now have to make your 
      elements communicate with one another in order to get your code 
      to actually work. You will learn how to call and connect your elements, 
      and how to exchange information between elements using so-called attributes.
    instructions: 
      - Go to the Plunker link below, fork the code and create your own element
      - Link them to the index page as shown with the hello-page example
      - Define and use your own custom attributes in your elements
      - Hit Run to see what it looks like
      - Use the resources below to elaborate on your code
