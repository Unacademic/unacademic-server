    Very important tools to know are the developer tools in browsers. They are used for
    many things like bug testing and experimenting. You can also use it to see
    the perfomance of the site. You can view your HTML, CSS and script
    combined, and you can actively interact with it. Google has very nice
    implementations, which is one of the reasons why we use chrome as a
    standard browser.

    description: >
      Dev Tools are a great way to test out some CSS and see it rendered right
      away. Often styling will not show because you have made a
      little syntax error. The console allows you to quickly change some of the styling and get direct feedback.

      - Change or add a few CSS values
      - Experiment a bit with the box-model, add a border or position an element differently

      conjuntion with your site. You can test very simple commands or do complex
      debugging. Your website can output to the console. If you add
      a console.log("hello") and then press enter, it will show up in the console.
    instructions:
      - Do some basic calculations in the console (for instance 1+1)
      - Try console.log("something")
      - Create a simple variable (type - var name = "Your Name") and call it by typing name
