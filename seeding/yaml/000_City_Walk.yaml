    You must be anxious to dive into the wonderful world of web programming.
    But the first thing we want you to do has sadly / luckily nothing to do with 
    code. The Citywalk will combine the knowledge you will get from the first 
    tutorials. Read on to find out how exactly you are going to do that.
  summary: >
    Get some last contact with the real world, before you disappear into its 
    virtual counterpart.

  - title: Citywalk
    description: >
      You must go out in the city of Amsterdam and follow one of the two 
      routes below. If you want, you can also follow both routes, but that's up 
      to you. While you are taking your walk, take pictures of things you think 
      are interesting; as many as you like. The purpose of this odd request is to 
      encourage you to make content, which you are going to use in this and later 
      assignments.
      
    instructions:
      - Take a lot of pictures!

  - title: Build HTML page
    description: >
      The next step is to build a simple html page and make it look nice with 
      some css. You're going to use the knowledge you've attained or will attain 
      in the HTML and CSS tutorials. We want you to build a site with the 
      content you just created!

    instructions: 
      - Use at least five of the photos you have taken during your city walk 
        accompanied by a short explanation on why you took them.
      - Create a valid HTML file with the necessary tags. Think of the main HTML 
        structure like html, head and body, but also the p tags and 
        img tags and everything else described on the tutorial pages.
      - For this assignment its best to create a CSS stylesheet in the head of 
        your document.

  - title: Share it with the world
    description: >
      Of course we want to see as well what you've done. So you'd better publish 
      it!
    instructions: 
      - Upload your code to Github gists. Make sure you do not post it 
        anonymously!
      - Make sure the images are available online as well. You can use a basic 
        image host like Flickr or tinypic.com.
