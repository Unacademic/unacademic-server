    Now that you have come up with tons of ideas on how to implement the Rijksmuseum 
    API, it's time to put one of those ideas into a real web component.
    It could be anything: switches, knobs, an image viewer etc. Your project 
    group's only limitation is its own imagination (and perhaps technical capabilities). 
    In the tasks below, you may jump back and forth between tasks, as insights in one 
    task may require jumping back to update a previous task. This is part of iterative 
    design.

tasks:
  - title: Going to the drawingboard
    description: >
      Try to get all your ideas on paper. Design your 
      application on paper or make a wireframe by using a digital tool such 
      as Moqups. Try to break down your concept in multiple components. 
      Think clearly about their structure, and how the user interacts with each 
      component.
    instructions:
      - Use pen and paper or a digital tool to make a wireframe of your concept

  - title: Choose a Web Component
    description: >
      Once your group has finished drawing a wireframe, you have to choose a 
      web component. Which one would be the best to choose? Try to further specify 
      this web component. How does the user interact with it? Which features are 
      essential, and which ones are less important? 
    instructions:
      - Have a group discussion

  - title: Make a Web Component
    description: >
      It's time to build your web component. Check out the accompanying Plunker; you 
      have already built your own Polymer elements. You can use these to realize 
      the idea chosen. Save it once you are done and share the URL in our 
      Slack-channel.
    instructions:
      - Make a web component
