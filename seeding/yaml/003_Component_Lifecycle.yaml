    Just like organisms have a certain lifecycle, webcomponents have a 
    lifecycle of their own. For example a component can be generated
    in your browser (DOM). Its attributes can be changed, or it can be 
    detached from the DOM. By using JavaScript we can tap into this
    lifecycle and add a certain amount of interactivity (lifecycle callback).
    For instance, you could make a loading screen by using this principle. One 
    of the first things we load into the DOM is a big component which covers 
    the whole screen (the loading page). Once the DOM is fully initiliazed we
    simply remove/detach this element from the DOM.

  - title: Get to know the lifecycles
    description: >
      The official W3C webcomponent specification defines four different lifecycles. 
      Polymer has the same lifecycles, but gives them different names and further
      specifies some of the lifecycles.  
    instructions:
      - Have a look at Polymer's lifecycle
      - You could also take a look at the official W3C specifications, but beware, it does get into some technical details

  - title: Design a slideshow
    description: >
      Your city walk through Amsterdam did not go unnoticed. Your friends and your 
      entire neighborhood asked you to share your experiences of your exotic 
      trip through Amsterdam. They want you to give a quick presentation about it. 
      Unfortunately your Microsoft Powerpoint trial just expired.Luckily your 
      newly acquired coding skills will save the day. By using component 
      lifecycles we can make a really simple image carousel or a slideshow. 
      Check out the accompanying Plunker. Almost everything has been set, you 
      only need to change two simple things. First you need to change the 
      photographs in the links array to your own photographs. Secondly you 
      need to figure out which two lifecycles we need to make the script 
      running. Remember to check out the Polymer reference guide in the previous 
      task.
    instructions:
      - Go to the Plunker-task (link below)
      - Change the images in the links array to your own photographs
      - Change the text "PUTLIFECYCLEHERE" to the accompanying lifecycle
