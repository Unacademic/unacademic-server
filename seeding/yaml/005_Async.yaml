    Asynchronicity sounds like a difficult term, but it simply is an indication
    of action and time. Asynchronous events do not necessarily occur at
    the same time. They might have to wait or listen for other events to happen.

    To understand what asynchronicity exactly is, it is probably better
    to look at examples from everyday life. As a matter of fact, real life
    is full of asynchronous events.
  summary: >
     A good way to explain asynchronicity is to take examples from everyday
     life.

        Imagine you are meeting up with two friends for dinner. You take the
        tram to arrive from point A to the restaurant but have to make a stop
        halfway to run some errands first. Your friend is taking the tram half
        an hour later from the same starting point but arrives at the restaurant
        before you do; she did not have to stop halfway. She then notifies the
        third of the company, who waiting nearby, arrives immediately. When you
        arrive theyare already having a second round and waiting to order food.
        You have to notify the waiter.
