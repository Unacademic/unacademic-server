    Now that your feet have recovered from the walk through Amsterdam,
    and your fingers have recuperated from repeated clicking on a camera button,
    it's time to do something with all the photos.
    However, while you have an innate understanding of why you photographed six
    hundred cats, your fellow students might truly be baffled by this.
    Discuss your photos and the photos of your fellow students and make a
    selection. Then place them in a JSON object.
  summary: >
    Select five photos in groups of three people

tasks:
  - title: Discuss your photos
    description: >
      Figure out what you find interesting in each others pictures. What is the common ground?
      There aren't any criteria, so choose whatever you think is best.
    instructions:
      - Work in pairs of three or four people
      - Examine your photos and make a group selection of 5 photos

      You decided on several photos. Place these photos in a templated website.
      We've got a plunker set-up with handlebars for you that you can use. Try to
      do this part individually again, it's important you understand how it works.
    instructions:
      - Fork this project
      - Create a JSON-structure of your selected photographs
      - All the photographs are stored in one big array called "photos"
      - 'Every photo is a separate object. It has the properties title: photourl, location, photographer.'
      - Render those pictures on your webpage by using a template(user proper HTML and style the page using CSS)
      - Post it in the Slack-channel
