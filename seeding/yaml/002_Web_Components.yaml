    Web components are the future of web development, but what are they? 

    We can for example create an element called <my-clock> that would insert a clock 
    displaying the time. Like any other element we could then reuse our 
    clock element whenever and wherever we need.  

    Web components enable truly encapsulated and reusable components for
    the web. This means we can easily create widgets and other useful
    elements that can be easily shared, without having to retype or 
    rework code. That is the beauty of web components.
  summary: > 
    Web components are reusable code elements

      Polymer is a library built on top of web components, making the 
      development of web components easier. Polymer has a certain way 
      of thinking how these web components are best used and created. 
      First familiarise yourself with Polymer and its methodology. 
    instructions:
      - Read up on Polymer on the Polymer Project website
