  - title: Add data to the graph
    description: >
      This graph will be based on the life and work of Karel Appel
      and must have two parameters; location and quantity of works. So,
      the graph will actually answer the question in which location did Karel Appel
      produce most of his works. The Plunker file below contains everything you
      need to complete the assignment.
    instructions:
      - Fork the Plunker code below
      - Pick another chart from the chart.js Polymer page
      - Look for an artist in the Rijksmuseum API
      - Count all the productionPlaces
      - Put all this data in your new chart
      - Save it and post it in our Slack-channel
