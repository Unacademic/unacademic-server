    We regularly come across fields on web pages used to collect 
    user input, like names, e-mail addresses, checkbox answers or messages. 
    This bundle of features on a website is a form. Forms are the most common 
    interface used on websites or web applications.
    A form consists of different form elements called controls or widgets.
    Controls are usually defined by input elements which in their turn have
    numerous different types. So, a form can have for instance three input
    elements; one with type "text" for name, another one with type "email"
    for e-mail address and a third one with type "submit"; the well known submit 
    button.
