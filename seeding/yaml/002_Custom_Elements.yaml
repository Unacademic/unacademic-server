    In web development some key principles proved to be very important. 
    When working on a project, things can get complicated fast. 
    That is why we must consider the maintainability of the project.
    A project should be able to grow easily, for example by adding new features. 

    In order for numerous team members to collaborate, a team should be able to 
    easily share their work. Web components are a good way to enforce 
    collaboration, because you can add features by simply importing a component. 
    This method also results in clean and readable code. With scalability and 
    maintainability in mind, components can be combined, stacked or replaced. 

    Most importantly because components are completely encapsulated, 
    it provides an easy way to share and reuse code. Working with web components
    is not only about creating your own custom elements but also about 
    incorporating other people's custom elements. Why create something that has 
    already been created? Instead of just collaborating with your team why not 
    share your components with the world? 
    
    In a very short time, this idea has already generated an active community
    that shares their components. There are many custom elements available; one
    could build an entire web application just from external components.

      Polymer already provides many standardized custom elements that are useful
      for building your own web app. These components are designed to act as 
      building blocks: you can mix and match and add your own.

      Custom elements are a great way to get started with building a web
      application. To help you visualize the way these components work
      together, Polymer has created a web tool called Designer. In Designer you
      can choose from all the web components Polymer has to offer and drag and
      drop them on the canvas.
    instructions:
      - Open the Polymer Designer and start combining some components
      - Also review the code by pressing the < > incorporating
      - Try to understand what changes in the code when you add a component

      Polymer is not the only community that produces components for everybody to 
      use. There are many individuals and companies who share their components 
      with the world. Customelements.io is a community where you can upload and 
      find custom elements. 

      For example, in the list you will find a custom element that creates a
      Github profile card. You could import the element with a single line.
      then you can duplicate it as many times as you like and modify it by
      adding or changing the attributes. 
    instructions:
      - Open the plunker file
      - The file is missing an important line of code. You have to import 
        github.html
      - Link the github.html file inside the <head> to make the components work
      - Add another card and change the attribute to display your github profile
