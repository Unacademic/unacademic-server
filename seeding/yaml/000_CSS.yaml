    This is the introduction to CSS (cascading style sheets). A CSS file allows 
    you to separate your website's markup content from its style. As always you 
    use your HTML file to arrange the content, but all of the presentation 
    (fonts, colors, background, borders, text formatting, link effects & so onâ€¦) 
    are accomplished within a CSS file.

  - title: Selectors
    description: >
      In order for CSS to work you first need to specify which element you wish 
      to apply CSS to. You do this with 'selectors'. Selectors are essentially 
      just names for the things you want to target and affect. Within the 
      {brackets} of selectors you place the effects you want to apply. In this 
      assignment we want you to create selectors.
    instructions:
      - Read the article.
      - Watch the video.
      - Add selectors to the html provided in the resources for the body,
        the paragraphs and each separate title.

  - title: Colors
    description: >
      Colors give life to a page. Black and white may be minimalistic and sleek, 
      but the possibilities that arise when you add, say, 50 shades of grey, add 
      so much to a website. This article focuses mainly on background color, but 
      the principles can also be applied to text color. Color a text and 
      background for this assignment.
    instructions:
      - Read the articles
      - Write a short text about how to use selectors in CSS.
      - Color your webpage and the text you just wrote.
