    HTML5 allows us to make template elements. A template can best be
    described as a mold with a fixed layout, which can be repeated multiple
    times. Instead of putting the content directly in the tags (as we did
    in our level 000 HTML course), the content and the tags are completely
    separated. This practice gives much flexibility and endless possibilities.
