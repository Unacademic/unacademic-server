    HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language. When you look at a web page on a 
    web browser you see, at the simplest level, words. HTML instructs a web 
    browser what content to display. In many cases a page also displays images 
    or maybe video clips. 
    HTML defines and separates "content" (words, images, audio, video, and so 
    on) from "presentation" (how to display a specific type of content). HTML 
    uses a pre-defined set of elements to identify content types.
  summary: >
    HTML gives directions to the web browser on what content to display. 
    It uses a set of elements to identify content types.

      - Tag the headings with the h1, 2, 3 or 4 tags, and the paragraphs with 
        the p tag.
      - Save the file, go to the folder it is in and double click on the file to 
        open it in your browser.
      - Congratulations, you just made a webpage!
