    Data comes in many forms, and data structures equally so.
    But as terrifying as arrays and objects might seem at first glance,
    they are easy to grasp in reality. 
    
    Data structures are used in all programming languages (and one 
    could even say in natural languages). The ways they are and 
    can be structured vary from language to language,
    but usually values are put in lists and lists within lists.

  - title: Get a grip on Numbers
    description: >
      Numbers are at the core of programming,
      not just webprogramming, but all programming.
      In fact, that computers run on binary code,
      i.e. zeroes and ones, can be considered common knowledge.
      But since writing programs in binary is a hell of a job,
      computer scientists have developed a number of ways
      to represent numbers.
    instructions:
      - Read the articles you can find below ("How numbers are encoded" is optional)
      - Watch the video

  - title: Get a grip on Strings
    description: >
      Strings are essentially a number of characters glued together.
      Strings can form words, sentences, URL's; basically anything.
      One important aspect of strings is that they are arrays,
      and like arrays they index at zero.
      Quotes ("") denote strings.
      The objective is to manipulate strings into doing what you want,
      by writing a little program.
    instructions:
      - Read the article
      - Copy and paste the article (or any other text) into one long string
        in your text editor
      - Change all characters to lower case
      - Make another string, this time of your name
      - Using a number of for loops and if statements,
        capitalise letters in the long text so that it shows your name over and
        over again
      - If you get confused, take a look at the Arrays task first

  - title: Get a grip on Arrays
    description: >
      Arrays are lists of data.
      Some only contain numbers, some contain characters.
      While strings are arrays, arrays may contain multiple strings.
      Arrays may even contain multiple arrays!
      The [] brackets are used to indicate arrays.
    instructions:
      - Read the article
      - Make an array containing the titles of five of your favorite books,
        movies, series or albums/songs
      - Add a title once using the push method, once using the unshift method,
        and once using a different method
      - Remove a title three times using different methods each time

  - title: Objects
    description: >
      Objects are slightly more intricate than arrays,
      but only slightly so. 
      Whereas arrays are simply lists, objects are lists
      with keys.
      These keys are words under which values are files.
      A quick example would look like this: 
      var captain = {name: "Katherine Janeway"};
      One fun aspect of Javascript is that virtually everything
      is an object.
    instructions:
      - Read the articles
      - Make an object containing the titles of five of your favorite books,
        movies, series or albums/songs using the creators as keys and the titles
        as values
      - Expand the object by making objects within the object for every key,
        adding subkeys and values for creator, title, year, and the reason
        why you think this particular artwork is so awesome
