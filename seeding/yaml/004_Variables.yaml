    Variables are containers for data,and like many other containers
    they are often labelled with a name. Because confusing H2O with H2O2
    by mistake will most likely kill you, it is useful to label your
    containers so that you have a good idea what is inside.
    In this case "water" and "hydrogen peroxide" would be apt container names.
    Sensible variable names makes code more readable and is considered
    good programming practice.

  - title: Get to know Variables
    description: >
      Javascript is a so called "dynamically typed language",
      which means variables only have to be declared as variables
      and not as the type of variable it is. In other words,
      a programmer only has to say "this is a variable",
      and Javascript does the rest of the work.
      This is in stark contrast with languages such as C,
      in which you not only have to say that something is a number,
      but also what kind of number. Since Javascript has
      only three types of data, this problem is not encountered often.

  - title: Learn about Scope
    description: >
      Scope is the concept of where variables can be accessed.
      For example, a variable that is declared within a function
      cannot really be accessed from the outside. However, a variable
      outside a function can be accessed from within the function.
      Scope is very important to keep in mind, because faulty scoping
      can mess up any program.
    instructions:
      - Watch the video
      - Read the article
      - Write a short program as an example of how to use scope
      - Include at least one local and one global variable
      - Use comments to provide deeper explanation
      - Explain the concept of scope to a friend, parent
        or your landlord using the example you just wrote
      - Hand in the example by posting a gist link on Slack

  - title: Meet Var and Let
    description: >
      In the new Javascript there are two different types
      of variables. Var is the one mostly used, let is the new one.
      Chances are you will seldom or never use the latter.
      Let is a special type of variable that can only be accessed
      in the code block where it is declared in. Keep in mind that
      this is such a new technology, you do not really have to master it.
      However, it lets you get a closer look at the principle of
      scope and a slight glipse into the future of Javascript.
