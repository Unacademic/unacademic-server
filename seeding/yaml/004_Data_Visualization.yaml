    Most of the JSON files we have been looking into so far have been pretty
    complex. It usually takes quite some time to wrap your head around them, and
    the same applies for most of the other data formats we encounter. However,
    there are ways to interpret the data more easily, and to make them accessible
    for a broader audience.

    One way to do this is with data visualization. As the name implies,
    it is basically the visual interpretation of data. You could visualize
    the data as bars, charts, lines etcetera. However, the more
    advanced data visualizations go well beyond the point of simple lines and
    bar charts. In this objective you will have a quick introduction to the basics
    of data visualization, and you will make a bar chart using the Rijksmuseum API.

      A lot has been written about data visualization, and we could easily cover an
      entire level with data visualization. In this task you will watch a short
      eight-minute documentary by the American Public Broadcasting Service. You will also
      read the first chapter of Tufte's book *The Visual Display of Quantitive Information*.
    instructions:
      - Watch the YouTube clip
      - Have a look at Tufte's article

  - title: Generate a bar chart using the Rijksmuseum API
    description: >
      By using very simple CSS we are able to create a bar chart. A bar chart
      is essentially nothing more than a set of colored rectangular shapes.
      In this case we made a bar chart which shows the number of art works of
      four different artists in the Rijksmuseum. To create a bar chart, we can
      simply make a number of div elements (the bars), and attach a height to
      each (for instance; height: 30 px).
      Next we give them a white background color (background-color: #fff).
      We can use the CSS width property to give the bar its length based on
      the number of artworks.
      We can get this number from the Rijksmuseum API, divide it by ten,
      and inject it to the CSS.
