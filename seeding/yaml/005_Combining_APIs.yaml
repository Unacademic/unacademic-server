    APIs are very versatile, but usually also specified on one
    particular data set. In order to achieve interesting, surprising
    and useful results, programmers often combine multiple sources
    of data. One frequently used interface is the Google Maps API. 
    People love to map all sorts of things, whether it is important
    data such as global carbon emissions or less important things such 
    as where the nearest Burger King is. Nevertheless, APIs can help
    a programmer with a lot of compelling problems.
    You will combine the Geolocations, Google Maps and Rijksmuseum APIs
    to create a new dataset.
  summary: >
    APIs are very versatile. Combining them can solve very interesting problems.

    description: >
      Mashing up is the principle of taking the data of two or more APIs
      or datasets and combining these to create something new.
      Usually this is achieved by taking data and juxtapositioning it with
      other data in such a way that a surprising and interesting effect is
      achieved.
      For example, Wheel of Lunch takes a location and what you want to eat
      and randomly selects a place in your vicinity where you can get that food.
      It does so by consulting the Yahoo Local Search API.
      Sadly, it told us to get our sushi at the Albert Heijn, so it's not 
      entirely flawless.
      This is just one of the many things that can be achieved with mashing up.

  - title: Combine Geolocations and the Rijksmuseum API
    description: >
      Combining the geographical data from Geolocations and the
      data from the Rijksmuseum is the next step to understanding
      API's. Displaying the data in an actual map, however, is
      going to be quite challenging. 
    instructions:
      - Check out the Plunker
      - The <get-coordinates> tag is now still in index.html, 
        but it needs to get into rijkmuseum-query.html
      - Once you can use <get-coordinates> into rijksmuseum-query.html,
        get the coordinates of the places of production of the artworks
        of a painter of your choice, using a template repeat
      - Make the browser display the name of the artwork, the artist, 
        the location(s) and their longitude and latitude
      - Not all artworks have locations and some have multiple, 
        so decide yourself how to tackle this problem
      - You get bonus points if you display the locations on a map,
        but it is not manditory
